# Tadpole-Docs: A Unified Documentation Hub for Federal Agencies

Tadpole-Docs serves as a centralized repository for documentation across various federal agencies, ensuring that up-to-date information is easily accessible and modifiable by the community. Ribbit, an innovative application, leverages Tadpole-Docs to answer questions about any API and its usage. This collaborative effort simplifies the process of accessing and understanding the diverse range of APIs provided by federal agencies, making it easier for developers and enthusiasts to access the data and resources they need. Tadpole-Docs is a valuable resource for anyone looking to interact with federal agency APIs efficiently.
